# To Do
- [ ] Bug: Pressing completed tasks when none are marked as completed in current list will remove all completed tasks from completedTasks array
- [ ] Searching for tasks shows if they are completed or not
- [ ] Add text to listList and taskList encouraging people to add list/task by pressing enter if they are empty
